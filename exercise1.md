### self-hosted vs cloud
When you run self-hosted services of course you need your own infrastructure for it and you are responsible to maintain the software and hardware. Managing self-hosted service should not be taken lightly because any downtime in CI/DI operations can affect in organizations productivity. 
Cloud services have higher cost, service usually start cheap but scales up very quicky. Self-hosted services are cheaper option but have hidden costs since you need computing power to run your systems. 
Self-hosted service have better security and trust because you managing them yourself. When using could services you have to evaluate your trust in the service provider.
